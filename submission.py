    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description of GameState and helper functions:

    A GameState specifies the full game state, including the food, capsules,
    agent configurations and score changes. In this function, the |gameState| argument
    is an object of GameState class. Following are a few of the helper methods that you
    can use to query a GameState object to gather information about the present state
    of Pac-Man, the ghosts and the maze.

    gameState.getLegalActions(agentIndex):
        Returns the legal actions for the agent specified. Returns Pac-Man's legal moves by default.

    gameState.generateSuccessor(agentIndex, action):
        Returns the successor state after the specified agent takes the action.
        Pac-Man is agent 0 and agent 1.

    gameState.getPacmanState(agentIndex):
        Returns an AgentState object for pacman (in game.py)
        state.configuration.pos gives the current position
        state.direction gives the travel vector

    gameState.getNumAgents():
        Returns the total number of agents in the game

    gameState.getScore(agentIndex):
        Returns the score of agentIndex (0 or 1) corresponding to the current state of the game

    gameState.getScores():
        Returns all the scores of the agents in the game as a list where first score corresponds to agent 0

    gameState.setScores(score):
        Sets the scores of the agents in the game according to the list score where first score corresponds to agent 0
    
    gameState.getFood():
        Returns the food in the gameState

    gameState.getPacmanPosition(agentIndex):
        Returns the pacman (agentIndex 0 or 1) position in the gameState

    gameState.getCapsules():
        Returns the capsules in the gameState

    The GameState class is defined in pacman.py and you might want to look into that for
    other helper methods, though you don't need to.
